# Physical Models
A potpourri of physics-based models.

Fibrous Filters - theory graphs of aerosol penetration across cylindrical fibers due to:
- diffusion
- gravitational settling
- interception
- intertial impaction
- electrostatic attraction
- polarization

Includes charges on Boltzmann-equilibrated spherical particles versus diameter size.
